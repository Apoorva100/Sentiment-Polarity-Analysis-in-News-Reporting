# Sentiment-Polarity-Analysis-in-News-Reporting
This project implements a sentiment analysis tool to classify news articles into positive or negative categories. It uses the Naive Bayes classifier from the NLTK library and enhances accuracy with negation handling. The project aims to discern the sentiment differences between fake and real news articles, using a dataset of 100 news articles.
